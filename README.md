# Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models
Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models built in Python using GAMSPy

## About These CGEs
While CGEs are definitely not as popular as they once were, and probably mostly currently dead in academia... they're still used in industry and likely still a nice addition to an economists' toolbox (and I'm simply having fun learning them).

A few months ago, GAMS officially released [GAMSPy](https://github.com/GAMS-dev/gamspy), allowing the popular method to solve GAMS models fully available as a Python package! This has made me way more eager to learn it, as it is just continuing to add on to the impressive amount of support for quantitative economics in Python. 

While their [official repo](https://github.com/GAMS-dev/gamspy-examples/tree/master/models) has lots of models, this repo is for other models that haven't been made using GAMSPy in Python just yet.

Currently, all the models are from the textbook 'Textbook of Computable General Equilibrium Modeling: Programming and Simulation' by Hashimoto et al., 2010. While these models were written in GAMS, I have converted them to GAMSPy and include some writing about the models in my own words.
